Football Radio - A Football Simulation Game

Description

Football Radio is a console-based football simulation game that brings the excitement of the pitch to your terminal. Players and Teams are generated with random attributes, and the game offers a dynamic and engaging experience with detailed commentary.
I have named it Football Radio, as it reminds me of people listening to Football Commentary on the Radio. And perhaps I will add AI voice-over for it later for that effect.
At the moment the output is only in German, but I am planning to add at least English to it, and the ability to switch between the languages at start.
